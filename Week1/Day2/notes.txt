Concepts:

    Breakpoints:
    - We code phone first always. It stacks it as a block. The bigger the screen, it begins to flex.
    -Tip: open the live server in the shape of a phone on the right of the screen.
    -The smaller the screen size, content will become hidden, sizing will change and grid systems will change. Goes from flex to stack and visa versa.
    
    Containers:
    -Eg of a container iadt website -> courses. 
    -has same concept of breakpoints with the sizing. The smaller the smaller the container is visible.
